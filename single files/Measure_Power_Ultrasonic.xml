  <mtc:Definition>The time-average ultrasonic power emitted by an ultrasonic transducer.  The measurement of ultrasonic power in liquid is based on the measurement of radition force using a gravimetric balance. The acoustic power radiated from the transducer can be related to the radiation force measured by an electronic balance.</mtc:Definition>
