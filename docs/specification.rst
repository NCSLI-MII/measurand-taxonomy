Digital CMC Construction
========================

Digital CMCs [1]_ should unambiguously describe laboratory services for
machine consumption. A CMC comprises a measurand specification together
with a measurement uncertainty. Sections `1.1 <#sec:structure>`__ and
`1.2 <#sec:CMCUncertainty>`__, adapted from
:cite:t:`CMCDev2` respectively detail the measurand
construction and the CMC uncertainty. The approved CMC taxonomy,
comprising uniquely identified CMCs together with templates of their
measurand specifications, resides at https://somewhere.there.

MII Measurand Structure
-----------------------

Simply stated, the measurand identifies what we intend to measure
:cite:t:`VIM3`. A measurement will fit its purpose to the
degree that the measurand specification unambiguously and accurately
describes the intent. Likewise, locating and selecting the correct
measuring instrument to perform a measurement or a laboratory with the
appropriate CMC to calibrate the instrument depends heavily on measurand
specification’s clarity and completeness. This certainly applies to
manual operations aided by human judgment, but becomes all the more
critical for unaided machine interpretation. We first discuss measurand
names and then the full measurand schema.

Measurand Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The measurand name, the measurand’s specific output quantity, matters
most for clarity. Therefore, MII documents tag their machine-readable
MII measurands with clear, unique, and fully descriptive taxons from a
defined measurand taxonomy. Taxons as measurand names apply only to
internal document encoding and not to human-readable documents. The
individual MII taxons adhere to the following structure and naming
rules:

#. Every MII document identifies a given measurand by the same unique
   taxon string. [UniqueTaxonRule]

#. Each taxon may have aliases, such as commonly used equivalents (from
   *ISO-IEC 80000* :cite:t:`ISO80000`, the KCDB, an AB’s [2]_
   conventions, etc.). These aliases may appear in human-readable
   documents generated from the digital document as the user prefers.
   [AliasRule]

#. Each taxon comprises a series of tokens separated by the period (.)
   character. [PeriodRule]

#. Each token uses the UpperCamelCase [3]_ naming convention, e.g.,
   ``FrequencyModulation``. [CamelRule]

#. A taxon’s first token represents the process type, taking either the
   value ``Measure`` or ``Source`` to identify an input- or
   output-quantity measurement, respectively. [4]_ [ProcessTokenRule]

#. The taxon’s remaining tokens indicate the measured quantity.
   [QuantityNextRule]

#. The measured quantity’s first token identifies the quantity kind
   :cite:t:`VIM3`, which shall unambiguously link to an
   M-Layer aspect. [QKEntryRule]

#. Any further tokens after the quantity-kind token hierarchically
   qualify the quantity, proceeding from more general toward more
   specific quantity descriptors. [QuantityHierarchyRule]

#. The string data format encourages concise tokens and widely
   recognized acronyms, e.g., ``DC``, ``RF``, ``PRT``, ``CMM``.
   [AcronymRule]

#. Parameters substitute for additional tokens to distinguish details
   within the same measurement process. [ParameterRule]
   ``Source.Temperature.Simulated.Thermocouple``, for example, covers
   all thermocouple types via a type parameter, whereas a separate taxon
   (``Source.Temperature.Simulated.PRT``) covers platinum resistance
   thermometers (PRTs) because the measurement process changes (sourcing
   resistance instead of voltage).

#. Special tokens with their own syntax identify common measurement
   scenarios. [SpecialTokenRule]

   #. The ``Ratio`` quantity token precedes the quantity-kind token to
      identify a quotient of two like-kind quantities. [RatioTokenRule]

   #. The ``Coefficient`` quantity token precedes two successive and
      differing quantity-kind tokens to identify a quotient of two
      unlike quantity kinds. [CoefficientTokenRule]

   #. The ``Delta`` token follows the quantity(ies) to identify a
      further quantity that differs when measuring the quotient’s
      numerator and denominator. [DeltaTokenRule]

   #. The ``Model`` token after a quantity introduces a standard
      instrument model. [ModelTokenRule]

Table TaxonomyExamples_ lists some taxonomy examples and
their KCDB equivalents that illustrate the MII measurand structure and
typical qualifier detail. Note that the taxon *as a whole* serves as a
metadata tag to identify MII measurands. Other than distinguishing
``Measure`` or ``Source`` processes, a taxon’s syntax and individual
tokens do not encode meaning for machine processing; the taxon structure
simply facilitates and standardizes taxonomy construction and
organization.

Special Tokens
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To aid in naming taxons, the MII measurand taxonomy treats two common
quantities specially: ratios and coefficients. The term “ratio”
indicates a dimensionless quotient :cite:t:`ISO80000`, such as
strain (length per length), amplifier voltage gain (voltage per
voltage), or refraction index (light speed per light speed).
“Coefficient” on the other hand, indicates a quotient of two different
quantities :cite:t:`ISO80000`, such as a transducer
calibration correction (voltage per pressure). A ratio takes the name
“factor” when used as a dimensionless proportionality constant
:cite:t:`ISO80000`. In practice, some common measurand names
ignore this convention, e.g., “reflection coefficient”, “index of
reflection”, both of which we compute as ratios and use as factors. Both
ratios and coefficients play into CMCs.

Ratios
''''''

We structure ratio taxons as ``…Ratio.Q``\  [5]_, where ``Q`` names both
ratioed quantities. ``Q``\ ’s structure follows the taxon rulesfirst a
token for the quantity kind representing an M-Layer aspect, then
successively more specific descriptors. So, ``Measure.Ratio.Pressure…``
would identify a ratio of two particular pressures and
``Source.Ratio.Power.RF…`` would represent a ratio of two microwave
powers. The M-Layer would have aspect entries for ``Pressure`` and
``Power``.

Coefficients
''''''''''''

Coefficients relate an instrument’s input and output quantities.
Unconditioned piezoelectric accelerometers, for example, output an
electric charge that varies with sensed acceleration, a response
requiring quantification. Manufacturers therefore specify a nominal
coefficient value that users wish to calibrate in order to correct the
transducer output, and so we want a CMC to describe a laboratory’s
compatible service. The MII taxon structure therefore includes the
syntax ``Measure.Coefficient.QOut.QIn…``, where the two quantities
listed after ``Coefficient`` have quantity-register entries and the
coefficient equals :math:`Q_\mathrm{out}/Q_\mathrm{in}`. Accelerometer
sensitivity would look like
``Measure.Coefficient.Charge.Acceleration…``. When the two quantities
require different descriptor tokens, the numerator’s descriptor tokens
appear directly after the two quantity names, and the denominator’s
descriptor tokens thereafter. So we would name a coefficient of DC
voltage to absolute pressure
``Measure.Coefficient.Voltage.Pressure.DC.Absolute``.

Delta
'''''

The two quantities involved in ratios and coefficients often have an
influence quantity that differs between them. For example, we might
measure a frequency response by first measuring an signal amplitude
:math:`V_\mathrm{ref}` at a reference frequency, then changing the
frequency and measuring the new amplitude :math:`V`. The ratio quantity
(:math:`V/V_\mathrm{ref}`) represents the frequency response between the
two frequencies. After the main quantity, the special tokens
``…Delta.QInf`` flags an influence quantity ``QInf`` (with a
quantity-register entry) that changes during the measurement. So using
AC RMS amplitudes in this example, we would name their ratio
``Ratio.Voltage.AC.RMS.Delta.Frequency``.

Instrument Models
'''''''''''''''''

So far, we’ve discussed ratios and coefficients only in a
point-measurement contextcalibrating a device at one or more measurement
points and determining a *separate* bias-correction coefficient value at
each point. Coefficients also arise in a separate but related context
though: the coefficients of a mathematical model (function) that
corrects instrument indications *over a range*. Examples include
ITS-90 [6]_ range and subrange functions for PRTs, quadratic or cubic
curve fits for force transducers, Callendar-Van Dusen (CVD) equations
for RTDs [7]_, and many others. In theory, we may assign any measuring
instrument a correction model and determine the model’s coefficients
from measurement results. Whether done at the calibration-point level or
at the range, function, or instrument level, such a correction function
with coefficient values raises the service from verification (that the
instrument meets tolerances) to true calibration :cite:t:`VIM3`.

Though either the calibrating laboratory or the customer may have
software to calculate modeling coefficients from the point-by-point
calibration results, the laboratory more likely has the expertise, and
for smart instruments, customers may prefer turnkey calibrations that
load coefficients into the instrument. This might drive CMC taxons for
identifying such measurement services. The MII tokens ``…Model.M``
serves this purpose, where ``Model`` signals an immediately following
defined model type ``M``. So if an instrument’s instrument specification
tagged a measuring function with
``Measure.Temperature.PRT.Model.ITS90``, then
``Source.Temperature.PRT.Model.ITS90`` would identify the CMC to
calibrate that function. In general though, the MII instrument
specification schema will provide for calibration models of any form for
which calibration services may assign coefficient values for smart
instruments and digital calibration certificates
:cite:t:`MJK:DataCompleteness`.

Formal Taxon Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following BNF [8]_ grammar defines the measurand taxon syntax

+-------------+-----+------------------------------------------------+

where the subscripts “n” and “d” represent numerator and denominator,
respectively, and RQK means registered quantity kind (M-Layer aspect).

Supporting Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The measurand name identifies the measurement and disambiguates it from
other measurements but does not specify the (critical) process or
capability details. Here we discuss the further measurand detail
required to clarify a CMC.

Definition
^^^^^^^^^^

Regardless of care taken in naming taxons, a clear, human-readable
definition helps disambiguate one measurand from another. This helps the
metrologist select the correct measurand from a list, for example, when
building an SoA. Also, since new measurands continually arise with new
technology or measurement techniques, we will never have a complete
measurand taxonomy. A definition thus helps determine whether the
measurand of interest appears in the taxonomy or requires a new entry.
Finally, an extensible taxonomy exposes both its taxons and their
definitions to change reflecting the current state of knowledge. For
example, if we everyone only measured static pressure, then the taxon
``Source.Pressure`` and its definition would require changes to
differentiate ``Pressure.Static`` and ``Pressure.Dynamic`` once a demand
for dynamic-pressure measurement arose.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

We devalue calibration without fully knowing and stating the measurement
conditions, the measurand’s state. Specifying the measurand’s full state
restricts its *definitional* uncertainty :cite:t:`VIM3`, the
range of (true) values that match the measurand; failing to do so may
inflate definitional uncertainty beyond other uncertainty components, or
even beyond the instrument MPE [9]_ specification, essentially making
the calibration worthless. We should define our measurands such that
definitional uncertainty remains insignificant relative to other
uncertainty components and include those definitions as metadata in
instrument specifications, calibration certificates and SoAs.

The measurand state includes input quantities, influence quantities, and
instrument operating conditions. Input quantities affect the measured
(calculated) value and usually the CMC uncertainty. Influence quantities
do not affect the measured value’s calculation but may affect the CMC
uncertainty. Both input and influence quantities determine the
measurand’s state and thus affect the measurement result, so CMCs and
their representative taxons should specify the applicable quantities.
Examples include dew- or frost-point temperature in chilled-mirror
relative-humidity measurements, frequency in AC measurements,
acceleration in accelerometer sensitivity measurements, temperature in
dimensional and many other measurements. For some measurands, a
non-numeric property such as a thermocouple type (J, K, S, T, …) may
apply.

The MII measurand structure refers to these quantities and properties as
“parameters” and defines both required and optional parameters. An
automated CMC search, a CMC uncertainty calculation and the actual
measurement will not all succeed without the required parameters’
values. Required parameters usually include the primary measured
(output) quantity. Optional parameters, however may remain uncontrolled,
perhaps invoking a higher uncertainty, or defaulting to a specified
(nominal) value. Taxons in the taxonomy catalog designate parameters as
required or optional as seems most appropriate, but when used in a CMC,
the laboratory will choose which parameters to require, which to make
optional with default values such as a 50 :math:`\Omega` input impedance or a °C
reference temperature, and which to omit entirely as immaterial to the
measurement process.

A complete instrument specification includes the (rated, limiting, and
reference) operating conditions :cite:t:`VIM3` for which its
specifications apply. However, an MII measurand taxon’s parameters
include instrument operating conditions only when they overlap with
laboratory capabilities. For instance, a voltage reference standard may
require battery operation (at a minimum voltage) for specified accuracy,
but this procedural detail does not distinguish one laboratory’s
capability from another. In contrast, some rated or reference operating
conditions may limit influence quantity values to ranges that some
laboratories may not achieve, such as a tight ambient-temperature
tolerance. In some cases, the CMC uncertainty would reflect the relevant
capability, but not for all instruments.

Measuring Intervals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The abstract measurand taxons in the taxonomy apply to any measured
value, so the taxonomy’s CMC templates themselves do not include
measuring intervals (ranges :cite:t:`VIM3` or nominal values).
Concrete instances such as CMCs, however, should specify the measuring
intervals over which they apply. The MII SoA structure
:cite:t:`DZ:SoAUpdate` includes this element, which
human-readable SoAs should show with every CMC [10]_. Besides their
contribution to CMC uncertainties, this allows intelligent searches for
useful calibration services, whether a quantity at a single point or an
entire instrument range interests us. This logic applies to not only the
output quantity, but also all the input and influence quantities and
operating conditions. Customers may choose to omit optional parameter
values for CMC searches or calibration requests, but SoA CMCs should
define ranges, if only single points, for all supported parameters. As
with parameter defaults, all ranges represent nominal values in CMCs
(and instrument specifications); measured values appear only in
calibration certificates.

Interchangeable Quantities and Scales
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some quantities have multiple scales or derive in known ways from other
quantities. For example, we may characterize a microwave reflection in
terms of “reflection coefficient”, “VSWR” [11]_, or “return loss” and we
convert between them via defined equations. Also, some instruments
(nominally) follow known models, such as thermocouples’
voltage-temperature responses. Table `1.2 <#tab:conversions>`__ gives
example values.

.. container::
   :name: tab:conversions

   .. table:: Equivalent quantities.

      +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

      +==================================+==================================+
      | reflection coefficient: 0.10     | VSWR: :math:`\approx` 1.2;       |
      |                                  | return loss: 20 dB               |
      +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
      | thermocouple input temperature:  | nominal type-K output voltage    |
      | :math:`\Delta`\:                 | :math:`\approx` 0.397 mV         |
      | 10 °C                            |                                  |
      +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

The question then arises whether CMCs should express multiple quantities
or scales to facilitate searches. The short answer: no. If customers
wish to search for a lab to calibrate a thermocouple over a certain
temperature range, they likely will not care to search by the
corresponding voltage range, even though they will want to calibrate the
DC voltage measuring instrument used with the probe over that range.
Software should handle such conversions where required. The same applies
to the microwave-reflection example. Laboratories, however, may list
multiple CMCs in their digital SoAs as they think useful. Customers may
also specify calibration results in a particular format, but that
pertains to calibration certificates, not CMCs.

current draft MII taxonomy schema.
