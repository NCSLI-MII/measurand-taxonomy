      label: What is the process type? 
      description: A taxon’s first token represents the process type, taking either the value Measure or Source to identify an input-quanity or output-quantity measurement, respectively.

      label: Measurand
      description: Provide a description of the measurand. Simply stated, the measurand identifies what we intend to measure [VIM3](https://jcgm.bipm.org/vim/en/2.3.html). A measurement will fit its purpose to the degree that the measurand specification unambiguously and accurately describes the intent. Provide as many details to describe the measurand as possible, including links to references. 
      placeholder: Tell us what you measure! For example, Microphone Sensivity. The measurand quantity is pressure sensitivity, ratio of dynamic output voltage to dynamic pressure, typically expressed as a logarithmic level quantity to 1 V/Pa. The primary calibration method is reciprocity that entail reciprocal measurements between a pair of microphones under controlled conditions per IEC 61094-2.

      label: Kind of quantity
      description: Provide a kind of quantity for the measurand. The measure quantity's first token identifies the [kind of quantity](https://jcgm.bipm.org/vim/en/1.2.html) such as length, or in some cases a particular aspect of a kind of quantity such as thermodynamic temparture or ITS-90 temperature.

      label: Does the measurand require a special token?
      description: Special tokens with their own syntax identify common measurement scenarios. The Ratio quantity token precedes the quantity-kind token to identify a quotient of two like-kind quantities. The Coefficient quantity token precedes two successive and differing quantity-kind tokens to identify a quotient of two unlike quantity kinds. The Delta token follows the quantity(ies) to identify a further quantity that differs when measuring the quotient’s numerator and denominator. The Model token after a quantity introduces a standard instrument model.
      multiple: false
      options:
        - Ratio
        - Coefficient
        - Delta

      label: Parameters
      description: Specify the measurand's full state such that its definitional uncertainty is insignificant to other uncertainty components. The measurand state includes input quantities, influence quantities, and instrument operating conditions. Define these as parameters in this section. For further details refer to the [parameters specification](https://measurand-taxonomy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specification.html#parameters).
